# Privacy Policy

**Last updated: February 20, 2026**

Stash ("we", "our", or "the app") is a personal collection management app. We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your rights.

## 1. Data Storage

All your collection data — including items, photos, tags, and settings — is stored **locally on your device** using an on-device SQLite database. We do not upload, transmit, or store your personal collection data on any external server.

## 2. Analytics

We use [PostHog](https://posthog.com), a product analytics service, to collect anonymous usage data. This helps us understand how the app is used and improve the experience. The data collected includes:

- Anonymous event data (e.g., "item created", "collection deleted")
- Device type and operating system version
- App version
- Language and locale settings

This data is **anonymous** and cannot be used to identify you personally. We do not collect your name, email address, or any other personally identifiable information through analytics.

## 3. Photos and Camera

The app requests access to your camera and photo library solely to let you add photos of your collection items. These photos are stored locally on your device and are never uploaded to any server.

## 4. Location Data

The app allows you to optionally tag items with a purchase location using a map interface. Location coordinates are stored locally on your device. The app uses [OpenStreetMap Nominatim](https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org) for geocoding (converting addresses to coordinates and vice versa). Your search queries are sent to Nominatim's servers; please refer to [OpenStreetMap's Privacy Policy](https://osmfoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_Policy) for details.

## 5. Third-Party Services

The app uses the following third-party services:

- **PostHog** — Anonymous product analytics ([Privacy Policy](https://posthog.com/privacy))
- **OpenStreetMap Nominatim** — Geocoding for location search ([Privacy Policy](https://osmfoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_Policy))

## 6. Data Export

You can export all your data at any time in JSON or CSV format through the app's Settings screen. Your data belongs to you.

## 7. Children's Privacy

The app is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children.

## 8. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated "Last updated" date.

## 9. Contact

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at stash@app.com.
